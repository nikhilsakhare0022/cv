  <h1>My Goals</h1>
  <p></p>
  <ol>
    <strong>
      <li>Why do I want to learn this skill?</li>
    </strong><br>
    After learning HTML,CSS and JavaScript it will be easy for me to learn Salesforce Developer Skill.I will learn Apex, developement of visual force pages and all other bunch of skills so that I will be able to crack next interview. I will get a very good package.<p></p>

    <strong>
      <li>What will I achieve if I learn this skill?</li>
    </strong><br>
    It will become easy for me to get a job as a Salesforce Administrator as I would have Admin plus Developer Skill which is in demand right now. <p></p>
    <strong>
      <li>How will this skill change my life and my career?</li>
    </strong><br>
    I will get a good job where I don't have to get stressed out alot like I have to right now. I will get a good pay and hopefully I will be able to buy my own house soon!
    <p></p><strong>
      <li>How will learning this skill impact the lives of my family,
        friends and coworkers?</li>
    </strong><br>
    My ultimate aim is to master in Salesforce so that I can easily get a job with highest pay and I will be able to buy my own house and live happily with my wife Poonam.
    <p></p><strong>
      <li>How will I feel if I never accomplish this?</li>
    </strong><br>
    I would probably not be able to get a job in where I can utilize my current Salesforce Admin skill and maybe I have to join anoher call center or customer service process where I have to take calls,chats or hadle emails and I am never going to grow and I would not be happy at that place. It will be like doing a job just for earning bread. I will also not be able to get any job once I get older than 40.
    <p></p><strong>
      <li>What would my life look like if I manage to accomplish this?</li>
    </strong><br>
    I would wake up in my own house and my wife will be sleeping with me. I dont I have to worry about money and I will be able to travel as much as I want. May be I would be able to freelance and do not have to worry about job until I die. My wife
    and chidren (maybe) future will be secured.
